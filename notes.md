# TODO:

- make the infoboxes for pins adjust position to avoid being off the screen
  or overlapping
- make the map pan to keep pins centered with a reasonable margin
- change pin management from start/end to an ordered list of pins

- store service area on event

- on dropping pin, establish direction, possibly swap pin on divided road
  for shortest route (avoiding extra routing for u-turn)
